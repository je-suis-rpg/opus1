# opus1

Opus 1 intends to be framework code for simple games. By using SDL and a retro game programming book from 1994, I want to see what exactly we can achieve with modern machines.

Back then the games ran fast even without hardare acceleration. What happens when we use the same ideas in 2021? I'm curious to find out.
